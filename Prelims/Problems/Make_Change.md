Chetan has just received his pocket money of 'N' Rs. As he is a college student, he needs to make changes for N Rs to carry out his daily transactions. Chetan is busy with college work so he wants you to find the number of ways he can generate change for N Rs from 'M' types of infinitely available coins {C1, C2, C3, . . , CM}.

# Input Format
First line will contain 2 integer N and M respectively. 
Second line contain M space seperated integers that represent list of distinct coins that are available in infinite amount.

# Output Format
One integer which is the number of ways in which we can get a sum of N from the given infinite supply of M types of coins.

# Constraints
* 1<= Ci <= 50
* 1<= N <= 250
* 1<= M <= 50
* The list of coins will contain distinct integers.

# Sample Input
4 3
1 2 3 

# Sample Output
4

# Explanation
N=4 and C={1,2,3} there are 4 solutions: {1,1,1,1}, {1,1,2}, {2,2}, {1,3}

###### Note: The order of the coin doesn't matter

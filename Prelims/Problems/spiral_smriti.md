# Spiral Smriti
Smriti is very found of spirals, she keeps making them behind her notebook all the time. When she learned programming, she wanted to make a spiral using her program. Her spirals in a program will be in form of a square which will have side **n**. The spirals starts with the top left corder moving clockwise and ends in the middle (refer the sample output). The spiral will have alphanumeric progression like 1 A 2 B ... until it reaches the end in the center. Smriti wants help to make the spirals.
